# About this project

This project was a class asignment developed with JavaScript vectorial canvas graphics. My idea was making a very challenging and aesthetic looking game, that when being played reminded in every moment the player that this game is no child's play. 

The way i archived that was by creating a creepy and hellish looking design, using various tones of red to remark that the character is in fact in the depths of hell.

The code consists in various custom made levels coded on the screen using vectors on top of a js canvas.
